# CEPI Vaccine Campaign Simulator
This project was implemented by **Perkins Lab at University of Notre Dame** and funded by the **Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI)**.

CEPI is currently investing in the development of a number of vaccine candidates and platforms, as well as undertaking planning exercises around the manufacturing and future deployment of vaccines once they are approved for use. This modeling project was launched with the aim of informing CEPI’s **Sustainable Manufacturing Strategy** by providing estimates of vaccine demand for stockpiling and outbreak response.

**Aim**: To inform CEPI’s Sustainable Manufacturing strategy by undertaking modeling exercises to understand the magnitude of vaccine manufacturing and stockpiling needed for CEPI target pathogen vaccines (Lassa, MERS, Nipah, Rift Valley Fever, chikungunya).

**Objectives**:

To understand estimates for vaccine manufacturing for a) stockpile needs and b) outbreak response for CEPI target pathogens
To estimate vaccine demand curve needs across a number of different outbreak scenarios and different vaccination responses
To develop a modeling approach that can be modified for use in estimating vaccine demand for other pathogens

CEPI is an innovative global partnership between public, private, philanthropic, and civil society organisations launched in Davos in 2017 to develop vaccines to stop future epidemics. CEPI’s mission is to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases and enable equitable access to these vaccines for people during outbreaks.
